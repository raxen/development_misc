# Embedding SQLite in a c program

http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/sqlite/embed_sqlite.html

## Compiling ##

Get the SQLite sources from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html.

Be sure get the the `sqlite-amalgamation-{versionnumber}.zip` file as this 
zip contains only 4 files compared to about forty in the tarball.

Place the sources into the folder *sqlite-amalgamation*, then run `makefile`.
